Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve computational problems. Here, we'll focus on the N-Queens problem, a classic example of a backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem is about placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

### N-Queens Problem - Backtracking Algorithm
```plaintext
function solveNQueens(n)
    board = n x n matrix initialized with 0's  // 0 denotes no queen, 1 denotes queen placed
    if placeQueens(board, 0, n) == false
        print "Solution does not exist"
        return false
    else
        printSolution(board)
        return true

function placeQueens(board, row, n)
    // Base case: If all queens are placed
    if row >= n
        return true

    // Try placing this queen in all columns one by one
    for col from 0 to n-1
        // Check if the queen can be placed on board[row][col]
        if isSafe(board, row, col, n)
            // Place this queen in board[row][col]
            board[row][col] = 1

            // Recursion: place rest of the queens
            if placeQueens(board, row + 1, n) == true
                return true

            // If placing queen in board[row][col] doesn't lead to a solution, then remove queen from board[row][col]
            board[row][col] = 0  // Backtrack

    // If the queen cannot be placed in any row in this column col then return false
    return false

function isSafe(board, row, col, n)
    // Check this row on the left side
    for i from 0 to col-1
        if board[row][i] == 1
            return false

    // Check upper diagonal on the left side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1))
        if board[i][j] == 1
            return false

    // Check lower diagonal on the left side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1))
        if board[i][j] == 1
            return false

    return true
```
**Explanation:**
- **solveNQueens function**: Initializes the board and calls `placeQueens` to solve the problem. If a solution is found, it prints the solution.
- **placeQueens function**:
  - **Base Case (`if row >= n`)**: If all queens are successfully placed, return true.
  - **Column Iteration (`for col from 0 to n-1`)**: Attempt to place a queen in each column of the current row.
  - **Safety Check (`if isSafe(board, row, col, n)`)**: Check if placing a queen at `board[row][col]` is safe.
  - **Recursive Call (`if placeQueens(board, row + 1, n) == true`)**: If placing a queen leads to a solution, return true.
  - **Backtracking (`board[row][col] = 0`)**: If placing a queen does not lead to a solution (dead end), backtrack by removing the queen and continue the search.
- **isSafe function**: Checks if a queen can be placed at `board[row][col]`. It checks the left side of the row, upper left diagonal, and lower left diagonal to ensure no other queen threatens the position.

Backtracking algorithms provide a way to construct a solution incrementally and abandon a partial solution ("backtrack") as soon as it determines that this partial solution cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
